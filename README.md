# Data & Database Creation

I created the raw data using Python's pandas and numpy libraries. I also downloaded and imported a library called Faker, which generates fake names for the customers table.

I created 6 products with fixed prices for each one of them. I intentionally wrote the prices as decimal numbers for a more realistic representation. I created 3 locations, and for every location, the shipping costs differ. The dataset represents an electronic goods retail company located in Europe, where Europe's shipping is the cheapest among all locations.

Once the Python code was finalized, I saved every table into a CSV file.

## Data Cleaning

As the data was generated using Python, there was no need for further cleaning, as it was already prepared for analysis. However, one limitation is that there was no opportunity to practice data cleaning on this dataset.

## Data Analysis

I uncovered various aspects of the dataset and answered as many questions as possible. The questions were mostly generated by ChatGPT, and I used SQL for exploratory analysis.
