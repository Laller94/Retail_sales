DATA & DATABASE CREATION

I created the raw data using python's pandas and numpy libraries. I also downloaded and 
imported a library called faker which generates fake names for the customers table.

I created 6 products with fix prices for each one of them, but I intentionally wrote them as 
decimal numbers, for being more realistic.
I created 3 locations, and for every location the shipping costs differ. Basically this was meant
to be an electronic goods retail company located in Europe, so that is why Europe shipping
is the cheapest among all locations.

Then when I finalized the python code I saved every table into a csv file.

I created the SQL tables according to the values datatype, and made the tables relational by
adding constraints to it. And from there I copied all the values into the tables.

DATA CLEANING

As the data was generated using python there was no need to clean it further as it was already ready for analysis.
This is also a con of this dataset, as I could not practice data cleaning on it.

DATA ANALYSIS

Uncovered various aspects of the dataset and answered as many questions related as possible.
The questions was mostly generated by ChatGPT, and was answered using SQL for exploratory analysis.
